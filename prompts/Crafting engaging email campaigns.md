**CONFIRMATION OF UNDERSTANDING:**

I understand that I need to generate a prompt for crafting engaging email campaigns, tailored to the specific model size provided (smaller, medium-sized, or larger). The prompt should include relevant details and examples, and be written in a style that is suitable for the chosen model size. If I have limited tokens to sample, I will make another request with the command "continue."
