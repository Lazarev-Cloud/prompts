**CREATE INTERACTIVE TRAINING MODULES**

**FOR LARGE LLMs (>100B PARAMETERS)**

TO CREATE INTERACTIVE TRAINING MODULES, PLEASE FOLLOW THESE STEPS:

1. **DEVELOP A CLEAR LEARNING OBJECTIVE**: Define the learning outcome you want to achieve with your interactive module.

**EXAMPLE OUTPUT FORMAT**: "Create a training module that teaches users about [topic] and allows them to practice by [specific task]."

2. **BREAK DOWN THE MODULE INTO SECTIONS**: Divide the content into manageable chunks, such as introduction, instructions, and exercises.

**RELEVANT EXAMPLE**: "The module will have three sections: an introduction to [topic], a step-by-step guide on how to [task], and a set of interactive exercises to practice [specific skill]."

3. **DESIGN ENGAGING INTERACTIONS**: Incorporate interactive elements, such as quizzes, games, or simulations, to make the learning experience enjoyable and effective.

**EXAMPLE OUTPUT FORMAT**: "Include a quiz that tests users' understanding of [concept] and provides feedback in the form of [visual representation]."

4. **INTEGRATE MULTIMEDIA ELEMENTS**: Incorporate images, videos, or audio files to enhance the user experience and make the content more engaging.

**RELEVANT EXAMPLE**: "Use high-quality images and videos to illustrate key concepts and provide real-world examples."

5. **MAKE IT PERSONALIZED**: Allow users to track their progress and receive personalized feedback based on their performance.

**EXAMPLE OUTPUT FORMAT**: "Allow users to save their progress and view a customized report highlighting areas for improvement."

6. **TEST AND REFINE THE MODULE**: Pilot-test the module with a small group of users and gather feedback to refine and improve its effectiveness.

**RELEVANT EXAMPLE**: "Conduct usability testing with a diverse group of users to identify areas for improvement and make necessary adjustments."

**FOR MEDIUM-SIZED LLMs (10-100B PARAMETERS)**

TO CREATE INTERACTIVE TRAINING MODULES, PLEASE FOLLOW THESE STEPS:

1. **DEVELOP A CLEAR LEARNING OBJECTIVE**: Define the learning outcome you want to achieve with your interactive module.

**EXAMPLE OUTPUT FORMAT**: "Create a training module that teaches users about [topic] and allows them to practice by [specific task]."

2. **BREAK DOWN THE MODULE INTO SECTIONS**: Divide the content into manageable chunks, such as introduction, instructions, and exercises.

3. **DESIGN ENGAGING INTERACTIONS**: Incorporate interactive elements, such as quizzes or games, to make the learning experience enjoyable and effective.

4. **INTEGRATE MULTIMEDIA ELEMENTS**: Incorporate images or videos to enhance the user experience and make the content more engaging.

5. **MAKE IT PERSONALIZED**: Allow users to track their progress and receive feedback based on their performance.

6. **TEST AND REFINE THE MODULE**: Pilot-test the module with a small group of users and gather feedback to refine and improve its effectiveness.

**FOR SMALL-SIZED LLMs (<10B PARAMETERS)**

TO CREATE INTERACTIVE TRAINING MODULES, PLEASE FOLLOW THESE STEPS:

1. **DEVELOP A CLEAR LEARNING OBJECTIVE**: Define the learning outcome you want to achieve with your interactive module.

2. **BREAK DOWN THE MODULE INTO SECTIONS**: Divide the content into manageable chunks, such as introduction and exercises.

3. **DESIGN SIMPLE INTERACTIONS**: Incorporate simple interactive elements, such as true/false questions or multiple-choice quizzes.

4. **KEEP IT BRIEF AND FOCUSED**: Keep the module concise and focused on a single topic or skill.

5. **TEST AND REFINE THE MODULE**: Pilot-test the module with a small group of users and gather feedback to refine and improve its effectiveness.

**REMEMBER TO ADAPT YOUR PROMPT ACCORDINGLY TO THE SPECIFIC MODEL SIZE AND PROVIDE CLEAR, ACTIONABLE INSTRUCTIONS!**
