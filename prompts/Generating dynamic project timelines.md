**GENERATING DYNAMIC PROJECT TIMELINES**

FOR LLMs OF UP TO 100 MILLION PARAMETERS:

* **SIMPLE PROJECT TIMELINE GENERATION**
Create a basic project timeline with a start date, end date, and milestones (3-5 steps). Use the following format: "Project XYZ will span from [start date] to [end date]. The key milestones are: [milestone 1], [milestone 2], and [milestone 3]."

Example output:
"Project ABC will span from January 15, 2023, to March 20, 2024. The key milestones are: Completion of design phase by February 10, 2023, Implementation of software update by April 15, 2024, and Final testing by May 1, 2024."

FOR LLMs OF 100-500 MILLION PARAMETERS:

* **DYNAMIC PROJECT TIMELINE GENERATION WITH VARYING MILESTONES**
Create a dynamic project timeline with varying milestones based on user input (e.g., number of tasks, dependencies, and resources). Use the following format: "Project [project name] will span from [start date] to [end date]. The key milestones are: [milestone 1], [milestone 2], and [milestone 3], with dependencies between [task A] and [task B]."

Example output:
"Project DEF will span from March 10, 2024, to June 15, 2025. The key milestones are: Completion of project scope by April 1, 2024 (dependency: task C), Implementation of new features by May 20, 2025 (dependency: task A and B), and Final testing by July 1, 2025."

FOR LLMs OF OVER 500 MILLION PARAMETERS:

* **EXTENSIVE DYNAMIC PROJECT TIMELINE GENERATION WITH MULTIPLE DEPENDENCIES**
Create an extensive dynamic project timeline with multiple dependencies, varying milestones, and resources. Use the following format: "Project [project name] will span from [start date] to [end date]. The key milestones are: [milestone 1], [milestone 2], and [milestone 3], with dependencies between [task A], [task B], and [task C]. Resources allocated include: [resource 1], [resource 2], and [resource 3]."

Example output:
"Project GHI will span from April 20, 2024, to September 30, 2025. The key milestones are: Completion of project planning by June 10, 2024 (dependency: task D), Implementation of new software update by August 15, 2025 (dependencies: task E and F), and Final testing by October 1, 2025. Resources allocated include: Developer A, Designer B, and Project Manager C."

**FILLABLE EXAMPLE FORM**

Please provide the following information to generate your dynamic project timeline:

* Project name:
* Start date:
* End date:
* Number of tasks:
* Dependencies between tasks (list):
* Resources allocated (list):

Example output:
"Project JKL will span from May 15, 2024, to November 30, 2025. The key milestones are: [insert milestone 1], [insert milestone 2], and [insert milestone 3], with dependencies between [insert task A], [insert task B], and [insert task C]. Resources allocated include: [insert resource 1], [insert resource 2], and [insert resource 3]."
