**PROMPT FOR LARGE LLM MODEL (BETWEEN 10-20 BILLION PARAMETERS)**

HERE IS A SAMPLE PROMPT TO GENERATE REAL-TIME DATA ANALYSIS INSIGHTS:

"ANALYZE THE FOLLOWING TABLE AND PROVIDE INTERACTIVE, IN-DEPTH INSIGHTS INTO THE DATA TREND. 

**TABLE:**

| Quarter | Sales Revenue (USD) | Customer Base Growth |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Q1 | 1,500,000 | 5% |
| Q2 | 1,800,000 | 8% |
| Q3 | 2,200,000 | 12% |
| Q4 | 2,500,000 | 15% |

**PROMPT SPECIFICATIONS:**

* PROVIDE A SUMMARY OF THE KEY FINDINGS IN THE FIRST MESSAGE.
* OFFER RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS IN SUBSEQUENT MESSAGES.
* USE VISUALIZATION TO ILLUSTRATE KEY INSIGHTS (e.g., LINE GRAPHS, BAR CHARTS).

**DESIRE OUTPUT FORMAT:**

* A TABLE WITH INTERPOLATED DATA POINTS TO SHOW PROJECTED SALES REVENUE AND CUSTOMER BASE GROWTH FOR THE NEXT QUARTER.
* A LIST OF ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS.

**EXAMPLE RESPONSE:**

"BASED ON THE PROVIDED DATA, IT APPEARS THAT SALES REVENUE IS INCREASING AT AN ANNUAL RATE OF 20%. CUSTOMER BASE GROWTH IS ALSO ACCELERATING, WITH A 15% INCREASE IN THE LAST QUARTER. TO CONTINUE THIS TREND, I RECOMMEND COLLECTING MORE DATA ON CUSTOMER SEGMENTATION AND ANALYZING THE IMPACT OF MARKETING CAMPAIGNS ON SALES.

HERE IS A PROJECTED TABLE FOR THE NEXT QUARTER:

| Quarter | Sales Revenue (USD) | Customer Base Growth |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Q1 | 2,700,000 | 17% |
| Q2 | 3,200,000 | 20% |

I ALSO SUGGEST CREATING A CUSTOMER PROFILING TOOL TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE DEMOGRAPHICS AND BEHAVIOR OF OUR MOST VALUABLE CUSTOMERS. THIS WILL ENABLE US TO TARGET OUR MARKETING EFFORTS MORE EFFECTIVELY."
