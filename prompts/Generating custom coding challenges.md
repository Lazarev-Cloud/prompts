**GENERATING CUSTOM CODING CHALLENGES**

**SMALL MODEL (<10B)**

*CREATE A SERIES OF UNIQUE CODING CHALLENGES WITH VARYING LEVELS OF DIFFICULTY*
PRODUCE 3-5 CODE CHALLENGES PER PROMPT, EACH WITH:
	+ A CLEARLY DEFINED PROBLEM STATEMENT
	+ RELEVANT EXAMPLE INPUT/OUTPUT DATA (0 SHOTS)
	+ A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE REQUIRED PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE AND SKILLS

**MEDIUM MODEL (10B-50B)**

*DESIGN AND GENERATE 5-8 CODING CHALLENGES WITH INCREASING COMPLEXITY*
EACH CHALLENGE SHOULD INCLUDE:
	+ A WELL-DEFINED PROBLEM STATEMENT
	+ 1-2 EXAMPLES OF INPUT/OUTPUT DATA (0 SHOTS)
	+ SPECIFICATIONS FOR THE REQUIRED PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE, LIBRARIES, AND SKILLS

**LARGE MODEL (>50B)**

*CREATE A SET OF 8-12 CODING CHALLENGES WITH VARYING LEVELS OF DIFFICULTY*
EACH CHALLENGE SHOULD HAVE:
	+ A CLEAR PROBLEM STATEMENT
	+ 2-3 EXAMPLES OF INPUT/OUTPUT DATA (0 SHOTS)
	+ DETAILS ON THE REQUIRED PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE, LIBRARIES, AND SKILLS

**ADDITIONAL GUIDELINES**

*CHALLENGES CAN BE BASED ON REAL-WORLD SCENARIOS OR FICTITIOUS SITUATIONS*
*ENSURE EACH CHALLENGE HAS A UNIQUE SOLUTION*
*INCLUDE RELEVANT METRICS FOR EVALUATING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE CODE SUBMISSIONS*

**FILLABLE EXAMPLE FORM**

| Challenge Number | Problem Statement | Example Input/Output Data |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 |  |  |
| 2 |  |  |

**CONFIRMATION OF UNDERSTANDING AND CONCISE SUMMARY**

I understand that my task is to generate custom coding challenges for an LLM of varying sizes (small, medium, and large). The prompts should include a series of unique coding challenges with varying levels of difficulty, each with a problem statement, example input/output data, and specifications for the required programming language and skills. I will tailor my language and complexity level based on the model size. If you need me to continue generating challenges, please use the command "continue."
