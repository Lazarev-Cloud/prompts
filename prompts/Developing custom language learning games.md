**PROMPT ENGINEERING FOR LARGE LANGUAGE MODEL (LLM) WITH 100 BILLION PARAMETERS**

TO DEVELOP CUSTOM LANGUAGE LEARNING GAMES, PLEASE FOLLOW THESE GUIDELINES:

**GAME DESIGN CONCEPT**: CREATE A SET OF INTERACTIVE LANGUAGE-BASED ACTIVITIES THAT ENCOURAGE LEARNERS TO PRACTICE THEIR VOCABULARY, GRAMMAR, AND COMMUNICATION SKILLS. THE GAMES SHOULD BE ENGAGING, CHALLENGING, AND ADAPT TO EACH PLAYER'S PROGRESS.

**GAME FEATURES**: INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING ELEMENTS:

1. **VOCABULARY BUILDING**: GAME LEVELS THAT FOCUS ON LEARNING NEW WORDS, PHRASES, AND EXPRESSIONS.
2. **GRAMMAR PRACTICE**: EXERCISES THAT TARGET SPECIFIC GRAMMATICAL STRUCTURES, SUCH AS TENSES, CLAUSES, AND SENTENCE TYPES.
3. **COMMUNICATION SKILLS**: ROLE-PLAYING ACTIVITIES THAT PROMOTE EFFECTIVE SPEECH AND LISTENING.
4. **ADAPTATION AND FEEDBACK**: THE GAME SHOULD ADJUST ITS LEVEL OF DIFFICULTY BASED ON THE PLAYER'S PERFORMANCE AND PROVIDE REAL-TIME FEEDBACK.

**EXAMPLE GAME DESIGN**:

|im_start|>Game Title: "Language Quest"<|im_end|>
|im_start|>Objective: Complete the quest by navigating through a virtual city, solving puzzles, and engaging in conversations with NPCs (non-player characters).<|im_end|>
|im_start|>Level 1: Vocabulary Building - Learn the names of common objects in the city, such as "bookstore" or "caf√©".<|im_end|>

**FILLABLE EXAMPLE FORM**: PLEASE PROVIDE A DESCRIPTION OF YOUR DREAM GAME, INCLUDING ITS NAME, OBJECTIVE, AND LEVELS. FURTHERMORE, SHARE ANY INSPIRATION OR REFERENCES THAT MOTIVATED YOU TO DEVELOP THIS GAME.

**OUTPUT EXPECTATION**: THE LLM AGENT SHOULD GENERATE A DETAILED GAME DESIGN CONCEPT, INCLUDING GAME FEATURES, EXAMPLE LEVEL DESIGNS, AND FILLABLE EXAMPLE FORMS. THE OUTPUT SHOULD BE WELL-STRUCTURED, EASY TO FOLLOW, AND INSPIRING FOR POTENTIAL GAME DEVELOPERS.

**TOKEN LIMITATION**: DUE TO THE LARGE MODEL SIZE, I'VE LIMITED THIS PROMPT TO 500 TOKENS. IF YOU'D LIKE ME TO CONTINUE, PLEASE ISSUE THE COMMAND "CONTINUE."
