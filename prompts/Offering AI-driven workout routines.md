**PROMPT ENGINEERING FOR LARGE LANGUAGE MODEL (LLM)**

**MODEL SIZE:** 175 BILLION PARAMETERS

**PROMPT:** CREATING PERSONALIZED, EFFECTIVE, AND FUN AI-DRIVEN WORKOUT ROUTINES

**OBJECTIVE:**

* GENERATE A CUSTOMIZED WORKOUT PLAN BASED ON USER INPUT (GOALS, EXPERIENCE LEVEL, PREFERENCES)
* INTEGRATE AI-POWERED ANALYTICS TO OPTIMIZE EXERCISE SEQUENCES AND INTENSITY
* PROVIDE VARIETY IN WORKOUT ROUTINES TO PREVENT BOREDOM AND PROMOTE LONG-TERM ADHERENCE

**SUBTASKS:**

1. **USER INPUT COLLECTION:** GATHER INFORMATION ABOUT THE USER'S:
	* FITNESS GOALS (WEIGHT LOSS, MUSCLE GAIN, ENDURANCE)
	* EXPERIENCE LEVEL (BEGINNER, INTERMEDIATE, ADVANCED)
	* PREFERENCES (FAVORITE EXERCISES, DESIRED WORKOUT DURATION)
2. **WORKOUT ROUTINE GENERATION:** CREATE A CUSTOMIZED WORKOUT PLAN THAT INCLUDES:
	* A SERIES OF EXERCISES TARGETING THE USER'S SPECIFIED GOALS
	* PROGRESSIVE OVERLOAD AND VARIETY TO PREVENT ADAPTATION
	* AI-POWERED ANALYTICS TO OPTIMIZE EXERCISE SEQUENCES AND INTENSITY
3. **WORKOUT ROUTINE CUSTOMIZATION:** ALLOW THE LLM TO:
	* GENERATE ALTERNATIVE EXERCISES BASED ON USER FEEDBACK
	* RECOMMEND WORKOUT VARIATIONS FOR DAYS WHEN THE USER NEEDS A CHANGE OF PACE

**EXAMPLE OUTPUT:**

* "FOR THIS WEEK, I RECOMMEND FOCUSING ON LEG DAY. START WITH 3 SETS OF SQUATS (12 REPS), FOLLOWED BY 3 SETS OF LEG PRESS (15 REPS). FINISH WITH 3 SETS OF CALF RAISES (20 REPS). AIM TO COMPLETE THE WORKOUT IN UNDER 45 MINUTES."
* "TRY THIS ALTERNATIVE WORKOUT ROUTINE ON WEDNESDAY: 3 SETS OF BURPEES (12 REPS), FOLLOWED BY 3 SETS OF JUMP SQUATS (15 REPS). FINISH WITH 3 SETS OF PLANK HOLDING THE PLYOMETRIC EXERCISE IN PLACE FOR 30 SECONDS."

**FILLABLE EXAMPLE FORM:**

* WHAT IS YOUR FITNESS GOAL? _______________________________
* WHAT IS YOUR EXPERIENCE LEVEL? ______________________________
* DO YOU HAVE A FAVORITE EXERCISE OR WORKOUT TYPE? _______________________________

**LLM AGENT INSTRUCTIONS:**

* USE ZERO SHOTS FOR SIMPLE EXAMPLES AND MULTI-SHOT EXAMPLES FOR COMPLEX ROUTINES.
* INCORPORATE AI-POWERED ANALYTICS TO OPTIMIZE EXERCISE SEQUENCES AND INTENSITY.
* PROVIDE VARIETY IN WORKOUT ROUTINES TO PREVENT BOREDOM AND PROMOTE LONG-TERM ADHERENCE.

**MODEL-SPECIFIC LANGUAGE:**

* FOR LARGE LLM MODELS LIKE THIS ONE, USE MORE SOPHISTICATED LANGUAGE TO DESCRIBE THE WORKOUT ROUTINE GENERATION PROCESS.
* EMPHASIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF AI-POWERED ANALYTICS IN OPTIMIZING EXERCISE SEQUENCES AND INTENSITY.
