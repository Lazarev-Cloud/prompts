**DESIGNING VIRTUAL SCIENCE EXPERIMENTS**

FOR LARGE-LANGUAGE MODELS (LLMs) WITH 10 BILLION PARAMETERS:

TO DESIGN A VIRTUAL SCIENCE EXPERIMENT, PLEASE COMPLETE THE FOLLOWING TASKS IN SEQUENCE:

1. **CONCEPTUALIZE**: ENvision a REAL-WORLD SCIENCE EXPERIMENT that DEMONSTRATES a KEY CONCEPT or PRINCIPLE.
2. **SIMPLIFY**: TRANSFORM the EXPERIMENT INTO A VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT, ELIMINATING any COMPLEX EQUIPMENT or IN-VIVO TEST SUBJECTS.
3. **DESIGN**: DEVELOP a SERIES of STEPS to RECREATE the EXPERIMENT Virtually, including:
	* DEFINING the EXPERIMENTAL QUESTION or HYPOTHESIS
	* OUTLINING THE PROCEDURES and MATERIALS NEEDED
	* ESTABLISHING any CONTROL GROUP or VARIABLES TO BE MEASURED

**EXAMPLE OUTPUT FORMAT**:

"Virtual Science Experiment: Investigating the Effect of pH on Plant Growth

Step 1: Define Experimental Question - What is the optimal pH range for plant growth?

Step 2: Procedures and Materials:
	* Create a virtual petri dish with soil and seeds
	* Simulate varying pH levels (acidic, neutral, basic)
	* Measure plant height and biomass after [X] days

Please provide a series of linked subtasks to design the virtual science experiment.
