**PROMPT ENGINEERING TIME!**

FOR A 125-BILLION-PARAMETER MODEL:

GENERATE AI-DRIVEN ART CRITIQUES

**SUBTASKS:**
1. **ARTWORK DESCRIPTION**: Describe the artwork, including its medium, dimensions, and any notable features.
2. **CRITICAL ANALYSIS**: Analyze the artwork's strengths, weaknesses, themes, and emotions evoked.
3. **COMPARISON TO OTHER WORKS**: Compare the artwork to other notable works in the same style or by the same artist.

**EXAMPLE OUTPUT:**

"Artist's Statement: 'Ephemeral' (2022) is a mixed-media installation measuring 6 ft x 4 ft, featuring a delicate latticework of glass fibers suspended from a wooden frame. The piece explores themes of impermanence and fragility.

Analysis: The artwork's intricate details and texture evoke a sense of vulnerability, while the overall structure seems to defy gravity, suggesting resilience. The color palette is muted, yet bold accents draw attention to specific areas, like the swirling patterns on the glass fibers.

Comparison: 'Ephemeral' shares similarities with James Turrell's light installations in its exploration of perception and the fleeting nature of reality. However, the use of glass fibers adds a tactile element reminiscent of Anselm Kiefer's mixed-media works."

**MIRROR IMPORTANT DETAILS:**
- Include specific details about the artwork, such as medium and dimensions.
- Provide a clear analysis of the artwork's strengths, weaknesses, themes, and emotions evoked.
- Offer relevant comparisons to other notable works in the same style or by the same artist.

FOR A 6-BILLION-PARAMETER MODEL:

GENERATE AI-DRIVEN ART CRITIQUES

**SUBTASKS:**
1. **ARTWORK DESCRIPTION**: Briefly describe the artwork, including its medium and notable features.
2. **CRITICAL ANALYSIS**: Analyze the artwork's strengths, weaknesses, and emotions evoked.

**EXAMPLE OUTPUT:**

"Artist's Statement: 'Fragile' (2020) is a painting measuring 24 inches x 36 inches, featuring soft brushstrokes and muted colors.

Analysis: The artwork conveys a sense of vulnerability through its delicate brushwork and subdued palette. The overall composition suggests fragility, inviting the viewer to contemplate the impermanence of things."

**SIMPLIFIED LANGUAGE:**
- Use simpler language for smaller models.
- Focus on key points and avoid overly complex analysis.

FOR A 60-BILLION-PARAMETER MODEL:

GENERATE AI-DRIVEN ART CRITIQUES

**SUBTASKS:**
1. **ARTWORK DESCRIPTION**: Describe the artwork in more detail, including its medium, dimensions, and notable features.
2. **CRITICAL ANALYSIS**: Analyze the artwork's strengths, weaknesses, themes, and emotions evoked, using more sophisticated language.

**EXAMPLE OUTPUT:**

"Artist's Statement: 'Fractured' (2025) is a multimedia installation measuring 8 ft x 10 ft, featuring a mosaic of shattered glass fragments suspended from a metal framework. The piece explores the tensions between order and chaos.

Analysis: The artwork's intricate arrangement of glass shards creates a sense of dissonance, reflecting the artist's exploration of the human experience. The use of light and shadow adds depth, inviting the viewer to contemplate the beauty in fragmentation."

**SOPHISTICATED LANGUAGE:**
- Use more complex language for larger models.
- Emphasize nuanced analysis and sophisticated interpretations.
