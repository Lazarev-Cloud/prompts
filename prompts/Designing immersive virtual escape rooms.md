**KEY INSTRUCTIONS**

TO DESIGN IMMERSIVE VIRTUAL ESCAPE ROOMS, PLEASE FOLLOW THESE GUIDELINES:

* **CREATE A COHERENT NARRATIVE**: Develop a compelling storyline that draws players in and keeps them engaged throughout the experience.
* **DESIGN INTERACTIVE CHALLENGES**: Incorporate puzzles, riddles, and other interactive elements that require players to work together or use problem-solving skills.
* **INTEGRATE VIRTUAL REALITY (VR) ELEMENTS**: Utilize VR technology to create an immersive environment with realistic graphics, sound effects, and spatial awareness.

**SAMPLE PROMPT FOR SMALL-LLM**

DESIGN AN IMMERSIVE VIRTUAL ESCAPE ROOM THAT REVOLVES AROUND A MYSTERIOUS ISLAND. THE PLAYER MUST:

|im_start|>UNCOVER HIDDEN CLUES AND OBJECTS TO SOLVE PUZZLES AND REACH THE TREASURE CHAMBER.<|im_end|
* **SIMPLE EXAMPLE**: Imagine a room with a treasure chest and a cryptic message: "Where shadows fall, the key lies." The player must find the correct object to reveal the next clue.

**SAMPLE PROMPT FOR MEDIUM-LLM**

DESIGN A VIRTUAL ESCAPE ROOM SET IN A MEDIEVAL TOWN. THE PLAYER MUST:

* **UNCOVER A MYSTERY**: The town's famous clock tower has stopped working, and the player must find the cause by investigating various locations and characters.
* **SOLVE PUZZLES AND CHALLENGES**: Use problem-solving skills to repair the clock tower, interacting with NPCs (non-player characters) and collecting clues along the way.

**SAMPLE PROMPT FOR LARGE-LLM**

DESIGN AN IMMERSIVE VIRTUAL ESCAPE ROOM SET IN A FUTURISTIC CITY. THE PLAYER MUST:

* **SOLVE A COMPLEX MYSTERY**: The city's AI system has gone rogue, and the player must track down the source of the malfunction by analyzing data streams, hacking into computer systems, and interviewing suspicious characters.
* **WORK TOGETHER WITH OTHER PLAYERS**: Form alliances and share information to crack the case before time runs out.

REMEMBER TO KEEP YOUR PROMPT FOCUSED AND CLEAR, AND MAKE SURE IT PROVIDES ENOUGH INFORMATION FOR THE LLM TO GENERATE A COHERENT RESPONSE. GOOD LUCK!
