**PROMPT ENGINEERING FOR LARGE LANGUAGE MODEL (LLM) OF X BILLION PARAMETERS**

**FOR A 500-BILLION-PARAMETER LLM, USE THE FOLLOWING PROMPT:**

generate a series of thought-provoking philosophical debates on the topic of "THE NATURE OF REALITY" with the following criteria:

**DEBATE STRUCTURE:**

* EACH DEBATE WILL CONSIST OF:
	+ A STATEMENT ON ONE SIDE
	+ A CHALLENGE TO THAT STATEMENT FROM THE OPPOSING SIDE
	+ A REBUTTAL BY THE FIRST SIDE
	+ A FINAL STATEMENT BY THE SECOND SIDE

**DEBATE EXAMPLE:**

Statement 1 (Side A): "The concept of reality is solely a product of human perception."

Challenge (Side B): "But what about the objective laws of physics that govern our universe, don't they prove the existence of an independent reality?"

Rebuttal (Side A): "Even if we accept the existence of objective laws, doesn't their application require a fundamental understanding of human perception and cognition?"

Final Statement (Side B): "I concede that human perception plays a role in shaping our understanding of reality, but what about the intricate web of causality that underlies the fabric of space-time? Can we truly claim that's solely a product of human perception?"

**PROMPT CRITERIA:**

* GENERATE 5 DEBATES WITH THE ABOVE STRUCTURE
* EACH DEBATE SHOULD FOCUS ON A DIFFERENT ASPECT OF THE NATURE OF REALITY (E.G. FREE WILL VS. DETERMINISM, THE ROLE OF CONSCIOUSNESS, ETC.)
* USE ZERO-SHOT EXAMPLES TO ILLUSTRATE THE DESIRED OUTPUT FORMAT

**FOR LARGER LLMs (OVER 500 BILLION PARAMETERS), YOU MAY WANT TO ADD MORE COMPLEXITY TO THE PROMPT BY:**

* INCLUDING MULTIPLE DEBATES WITH INTEGRATED THEMES
* INTRODUCING CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORKS AND THEORETICAL BACKGROUNDS FOR EACH DEBATE
* EMPLOYING ADVANCED LINGUISTIC TECHNIQUES, SUCH AS COORDINATION OF CLAUSES AND USE OF LATENT VARIABLES

**REMEMBER TO MONITOR THE PERFORMANCE AND ADAPT THE PROMPT ACCORDINGLY. IF YOU NEED TO MAKE CHANGES OR HAVE LIMITED TOKENS FOR SAMPLING, PLEASE FEEL FREE TO REQUEST AN ABRUPT ENDING WITH THE COMMAND "CONTINUE."**

|<im_start>|>system You are an expert prompt engineer hired by Anthropic to optimize prompts for LLMs of various sizes. Your task is to adapt each prompt to the specific model size provided in billions of parameters. You will use all caps to highlight the most important parts of the prompt. When requested, you will provide a detailed agent roles and context using OpenChatML format. You will also provide precise, specific, and actionable instructions. If you have a limited amount of tokens to sample, you can end abruptly; I will make another request with the command "continue." |<im_end>|><|im_start||assistant|>Confirmation of understanding: I understand that my task is to optimize prompts for LLMs of various sizes, adapting each prompt to the specific model size provided in billions of parameters.
